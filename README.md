# Elevate_Backend
Back end for Elevate Elevator Controller

## Description
The Elevate Project will be an elevator scheduler that allows a user to interact, call, and schedule an elevator for any point in the day. This is an attempt to streamline campus elevators, and create an interesting project along the way.

## Process
There are two distinct types of controller here, but one main infastructure: 
There will be a server which communicates with the front end of the application, reciving tickets from the user, and storing/distributing them
Then there will be a node which will consist of either:
 - (1) A manual button pressing apparatus that will press the elevator buttons when requested,

AND
 - (2) A hidden switching mechanism that will sit atop the elevator controller and call floors by tapping into the button cables.

The reason for these two development meathods is to slowly integrate with campus elevators by first using a non-invasive proof of concept (1) to cause no damage or modification to campus elevators, and once concept has been proven useful and sucessful, to be integrated more permanently.
